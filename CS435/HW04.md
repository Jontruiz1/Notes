1.  For each of the 10 grammars listed above, indicate the smallest (most restrictions on production rules) class of grammars for which it belongs. Some of these grammars may generate languages that can be generated by a grammar with productions of a more restrictive form. Give answers based upon only the form of production rules in each grammar above. Indicate: Phrase-structure Grammar, Context-Sensitive Grammar, Context-Free Grammar (with ϵ-productions allowed), or Regular Grammar (with ϵ-productions allowed).

G1 is a Context-Free Grammar
A Context-Free grammar has the following form:
A $\to$ $\beta$  where A $\in$ $V_N$  and $\beta$ $\in$ $V^+$ 
In the case of G1, 
S $\to$ aSb where S $\in$ $V_N$ and aSb $\in$ $V^+$ and S $\to$ ab where S $\in$ $V_N$ and ab $\in$ $V^+$ 

S $\to$ bDc | Db | b
D $\to$ bbDc | b | $\epsilon$  

bDc $\to$ bbc | bbbDcc | b$\epsilon$c
Db $\to$ bbDcb | bb | $\epsilon$b
bbDc $\to$ bb$\epsilon$c | bbbbDcc | bbbc

G2 is a Context-Free Grammar
