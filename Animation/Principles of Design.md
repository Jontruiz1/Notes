Hierarchy
- Control how a view engages with info to ensure info is navigated
- Where do you want eye to look at first, second, third and so on
- Visual hierarchy
	- If every element appears important, nothing will seem important
	- Rank information you're consuming. Poor hierarchy occurs when theres no way to differentiate between elements
